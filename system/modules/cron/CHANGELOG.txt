--------------------------
- Adjustments for 2.7.1

--------------------------
- Change from global scalars $cronJobEndtime and $cronJobCompleted to array $cronJob

  (See http://www.typolight.org/wiki/extensions:cron#creating-well-behaved-batches)
  
Version 0.3.1 (2007-10-06)
--------------------------

--------------------------

  (See http://www.typolight.org/wiki/extensions:cron#creating-well-behaved-batches)

Version 0.2.1 (2007-09-30)
--------------------------
- Speed optimizations
- Changed scheduler icon

Version 0.2.0 (2007-09-29)
--------------------------
- Capture all output while running the job and save it in the system log. 
  A job running without problem is supposed to execute silently (not to echo 
  anything), so we flag it TL_ERROR when any output was captured. This is 
  also great for debugging new batch scripts btw.

- Switch error_level to E_ALL while executing the job, so we dont miss a 
  potential problem in the batch script.

  
Version 0.1.1 (2007-09-29)
--------------------------
- First public release
